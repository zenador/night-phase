'Hide Info' hides the entire top info box in case another player looks at your browser window. Click 'Show Info' when you need to look at it again.<br><br>

You can select some text in the top info box (only text below 'What you know') and click 'Hide Selected Info' to hide the highlighted text before showing it to another player if you need to share only part of your role information. When done, click 'Restore Info' to show the original text as per normal.<br><br>

When chatting, if you can see the 'Send as your role' option, it allows you to show your role name instead of your player name as the sender of your chat message (careful!). The 'Send only to host' option (visible only if enabled by the host) allows you to send a private message to the current game host that no one else can see.<br><br>

In the player list box (when displayed by the host), you can type some open info to show to everyone next to your name. You can also peek at or swap roles if the host has enabled that option (when the game requires it). These actions are logged, so everyone will know at the end of the game (or whenever the host chooses to display the log) if you cheated.<br><br>

If the sound box is displayed, you can tap the button to play a sound on the host's device 2 seconds later (so no one knows who triggered it), to signify when you're done with your night action.
